Operating Systems Project: Process Scheduling Simulation
ðŸ”¹ What You Will Do
You will write a program that simulates how an Operating System schedules processes using different
algorithms.
âœ… Step 1: Read Process Data from a File
1. Create a text file (e.g., processes.txt) with a list of processes.
2. Each process should have:
o Process ID (PID)
o Arrival Time (When the process arrives in the system)
o Burst Time (How long the process needs the CPU)
o Priority (If using Priority Scheduling)
Example of processes.txt:
PID Arrival_Time Burst_Time Priority
1 0 5 2
2 2 3 1
3 4 2 3
3. Your program should read this file and store the data in memory.
âœ… Step 2: Implement Two Scheduling Algorithms
You must write code for at least two of these CPU scheduling algorithms:
âœ… First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) â†’ The first process that arrives runs first.
âœ… Shortest Job First (SJF) â†’ The process with the smallest burst time runs first.
âœ… Round Robin (RR) â†’ Each process gets a fixed time (time quantum), then the next process runs.
âœ… Priority Scheduling â†’ Processes with a higher priority run first.

Each algorithm should:
! Sort the processes based on the algorithm's rule.
! Simulate execution (decide which process runs at each step).
! Calculate Waiting Time (WT) and Turnaround Time (TAT).
âœ… Step 3: Display a Gantt Chart (Execution Order)
1. Your program should show the order in which processes run.
2. Display a simple text-based Gantt chart in the console.
Example Output:
| P1 | P2 | P3 | P1 | P4 |
0 2 5 7 12 15
3. At the end, print:
o Waiting Time (WT) for each process
o Turnaround Time (TAT) for each process
o Average WT and TAT
âœ… Step 4: (Optional) Implement Memory Management
If you want to go further, you can add memory allocation:
! First-Fit, Best-Fit, or Worst-Fit allocation
! Simulate paging and page replacement (FIFO, LRU)
âœ… Step 5: Submit Your Work
1âƒ£Your programâ€™s source code (C, C++, or Java).
2âƒ£Your input file (processes.txt) and sample output (Gantt chart + calculations).
3âƒ£A short report (2-4 pages, PDF) explaining:
â€¢ What scheduling algorithms you implemented
â€¢ Sample test cases and results
â€¢ Any challenges you faced

ðŸ“‚ Submission Requirements
Each group must submit:
1âƒ£Source Code
â€¢ Provide a well-documented C, C++, or Java program.
â€¢ Use command-line arguments or a menu-driven approach for user input.
2âƒ£Sample Input & Output
â€¢ Submit a test file and corresponding output.
â€¢ Example Output (Gantt Chart Representation):
| P1 | P2 | P3 | P1 | P4 |
0 2 5 7 12 15
â€¢ Display waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization in the final output.
3âƒ£Report (2-4 Pages, PDF)
â€¢ Overview: What algorithms were implemented?
â€¢ Implementation Details: How did you handle process scheduling?
â€¢ Results: Show sample runs and performance comparison (e.g., FCFS vs. RR).
â€¢ Challenges & Solutions: What difficulties did you face?
ðŸ“Š Grading Criteria
Category Points Description
Correct Implementation of Two Scheduling Algorithms 40 Must work correctly & produce expected results
Gantt Chart & Performance Metrics 20 Shows execution order, waiting time, and TAT
File Handling & Process Input 10 Reads input file correctly
Code Quality & Documentation 10 Well-structured, readable, and commented code
Report Quality 10 Clear explanation & sample outputs
Bonus (Memory Management) 10 Extra points for implementing memory management
ðŸ“¢ Final Notes
! Collaboration is encouraged, but each project must be unique.
! You do NOT need to pay for anything â€“ Use free tools like C, C++, or Java.
! No special software is required â€“ A basic text editor and compiler are enough.
! Test your program with different process sets before submitting.
! Think practicallyâ€”how does an OS efficiently schedule processes?
